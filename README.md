#TideData


A web app for finding high and low tides for a given day and location.

##Purpose
This app allows users to select a US Coastal location and a date; the app displays that date's high and low tide for that location.  The date can be changed, and an Ajax request displays the corresponding tides.

##Languages
This app was built using HTML/CSS/JavaScript with a dash of PHP.

##Future
The TideData repo will be converted to a Rails app, found at the [tide_data_rails](http://github.com/sealocal/tide_data_rails) repo.
