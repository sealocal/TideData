#TideData

A web app for finding high and low tides for a given day and location.

##History
TideData was converted to a Rails app in April 2014. You can find the future of this project at the [tide-data-rails](http://github.com/sealocal/tide-data-rails) repo.


##Purpose
This app allows users to select a US Coastal location and a date; the app displays that date's high and low tide for that location.  The date can be changed, and an Ajax request displays the corresponding tides.

##Languages
This app was built using HTML/CSS/JavaScript with a dash of PHP.
